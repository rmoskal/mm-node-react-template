## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
$ npm run server
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080/** to view the app.

## Commands

A core philosophy of this skeleton app is to keep the tooling to a minimum. For this reason, you can find all the commands in the `scripts` section of [package.json](package.json).

### server

```sh
$ npm run server
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

This leverages [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) to automatically start a local dev server and refresh file changes on the fly without reloading the page.

It also automatically includes source maps, allowing you to browse code and set breakpoints on the original ES6 code:

### build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

**Output:** `build/app.js`

Build minified app for production using the [production](http://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html#production-shortcut-p) shortcut.

### test

```sh
$ npm test
```

**Input:** `test/main.js`

**Output:** `coverage/`

Leverages [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) to execute the test suite and generate code coverage reports using [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)

### coveralls

```sh
$ npm run coveralls
```

**Input:** `coverage/lcov.info`

Sends the code coverage report generated by [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io/).

### clean

```sh
$ npm run clean
```

**Input:** `build/app.js`

Removes the compiled app file from build.

## Environment variables

If you run from the docker-compose file at the root project level, eveverything should just work.  If you want to run
the different components, then you need a .env file at this level.  At present these are the keys that need defining:

    RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://hazel:threarah@localhost:5672/muckrack
    MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/server
    BPM_URL=http://localhost:8080/rest/engine/default/
    PORT=8000
